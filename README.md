# CFB-NFL-Dash
## Creating a dashboard of win history with the feature to look at last time two teams won the same weekend
### Current Progress
- 12/17/2020: Obtained data from sports-reference.com and api.collegefootballdata.com. Cleaned CFB and NFL data to be prepped for import into Tableau

### Potential Features
- Actions to check the history of two teams playing on the same weekend
- Check for correlations between 2 teams
- Possibly expand to more than 2 teams
- If successful, include other leagues (NBA, NCAAB, MLB, EPL, etc.)
